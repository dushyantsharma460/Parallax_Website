            <p class="text1">Have you seen this strange cartoon that appears Monday nights, on Cartoon Network? It’s called Adventure Time, and I have to admit, my whole family is in love with it. When I say that it is strange, I mean that it is like no other cartoon you have ever watched before.
            <br><br>Now the time to adventure in real World.First we adventure on biking then para gliding after all that in Last we see surfing.</p>

                <p class="text1">Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You’ll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes.
                <br><br>Mountain biking is trickier because you have to navigate hills and surfaces, so your upper body and core will kick into gear. It’s more of a total-body workout than biking on the road, which is mostly a lower-body cardio workout.</p>

                <p class="text1">Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes.
                    <br><br>With paragliding the objective is to stay in the air, to fly. A paragliding wing generates lift through a forward motion in the air, just like a glider. A paragliding wing weighs about 5 kg, and is carried in a backpack.</p>
